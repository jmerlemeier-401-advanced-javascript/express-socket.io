Week 4 Capstone

Event based API
This is an UNGRADED pair programming assignment. Please take the next hour to accomplish the following:
Requirements
Create a file called app.js that instantiates an express application with the following features.
Stores an in memory data structure called messages. Which stores a list of messages with the following properties:
id: { String } Unique

Opens a Socket.io server host for web clients.

Emits an event title MESSAGE_FETCH and sends a payload to all connected sockets, containing messages.
POST /messages

Replaces a message object in messages by searching for the id on on a message object matching the request parameter :id.
Emits an event title MESSAGE_UPDATE and sends a payload to all connected sockets, containing the updated message object.

The logger listens for three events and console logs the event, and their payload:
